# **_Chatbot with Mistral-7B / Llama2-7B Models_**

## About
This project demonstrates a chatbot powered by two state-of-the-art large language models: **Mistral-7B** / **Llama2-7B**. Both models are optimized for generating human-like responses and can be deployed locally or in the cloud. 

The chatbot is built using the **Hugging Face Transformers** library, **Gradio** for the web interface, and **bitsandbytes** for 8-bit quantization to reduce memory usage. This project showcases how to load pre-trained models, generate responses, and create a user-friendly interface for interaction.

### Key Features
* **Models**: 
  - **Mistral-7B**: A modern language model with 7 billion parameters, optimized for instruction-following tasks.
  - **Llama2-7B**: A powerful open-source model from Meta, designed for conversational AI.
* **Quantization**: Support for 8-bit quantization to reduce GPU memory requirements.
* **Offline Mode**: Ability to run the chatbot offline by downloading model files locally.
* **Online Mode**: Option to load models directly from Hugging Face Hub (requires internet access and authentication).
* **Web Interface**: A simple and intuitive Gradio-based UI for seamless user interaction.
* **Optimized Performance**: Configurations for both GPU (CUDA) and CPU environments.
